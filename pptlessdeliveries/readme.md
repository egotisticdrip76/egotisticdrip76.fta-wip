# Slideless Deliveries

## What is this?

A way to engage with our customers and educate them without the need of custom PowerPoint presentations, leveraging public documentation.

## Why?

**Customers** often feel bored and loose focus when they are presented with another PowerPoint deck. 

**Our hint:** When they are the ones controlling the session, it is easier to keep them engaged, and consequently they will learn more and quickly.


**Engineers** invest time in preparing and keeping up to date PowerPoint decks that will only scale to FTA customers. 

**Our goal:** We can invest this time, improving the official contents that can scale to all Azure customers.


## How?

This approach and ideas are completely based on our customer experience and not based on any formal study.

Based on this, we will start an experiment with customer to evaluate the value for them.

Stay tuned!
